# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: "Star Wars" }, { name: "Lord of the Rings" }])
#   Character.create(name: "Luke", movie: movies.first)
# leave_allocations = Leave_allocations.create([{month: "January", credit: "1.0"}, 
# {month: "Febuary", credit: "1.0"}, 
# {month: "March", credit: "2.0"}, 
# {month: "April", credit: "1.0"}, 
# {month: "May", credit: "1.0"}, 
# {month: "June", credit: "2.0"}, 
# {month: "July", credit: "1.0"}, 
# {month: "August", credit: "1.0"}, 
# {month: "September", credit: "2.0"},
# {month: "October", credit: "1.0"},
